# AGENTS.md

Conventions and gotchas for anyone (human or agent) working on this codebase. `README.md` covers setup, scripts, deployment, media, privacy posture and local-dev troubleshooting; this file covers the rules and traps when changing code.

## Architecture

- Astro v7, `output: "server"`, deployed as the Cloudflare **Worker** `orboro-net` via `@astrojs/cloudflare` (Workers Builds, git-integrated with GitHub `jmusick/orboro`: a push to `master` runs `npm run build` + `npx wrangler deploy`).
- `wrangler.toml` is the source of truth for bindings and runtime config (D1 `DB`, R2 `MEDIA`, static `ASSETS`, compatibility flags, logs/traces). `astro build` writes the real deploy config to `dist/server/wrangler.json`. Custom domains, production secrets and edge rules live outside the repo; do not infer their live settings from source.
- All content (pages, posts, categories, nav) lives in D1, not markdown files. `src/lib/content.ts` is the data-access layer.
- Auth is custom (PBKDF2 hashing, D1-backed opaque session tokens, 14-day lifetime): `src/lib/auth.ts`, `src/middleware.ts`. There is no setup or registration UI; a fresh or restored D1 gets its first admin from `npm run admin:create`.
- Current operation is a single user, JD, with the admin role. `editor`/`author` remain in the schema and route guards, but author ownership restrictions are absent; adding non-admin users needs a permissions review first.
- Styling is hand-written scoped CSS per component using the variables in `BaseLayout.astro` (`--bg`, `--surface`, `--surface-2`, `--text`, `--muted`, `--accent`, `--accent-2`, `--accent-3`, `--line`, plus the type and layout tokens below). No Tailwind, no component library.

## Design system

The v1.37.0 refresh took the palette and type from the brand's own assets. Keep new work inside it.

**Color.** `--accent: #70d0ff` is the orb blue sampled from `public/images/logo.png`; `--bg: #080b18`, `--surface: #0e1428`, `--surface-2: #131a33` are the header art's indigo. `--accent-2` (pink) and `--accent-3` (lime) survive only for `Pill.astro` status colors: keep them out of chrome, backgrounds and gradients. The page background is one faint indigo nebula; don't bring back the cyan/pink/lime radial blobs.

**Gotcha: the accent is hardcoded far beyond the token.** About 160 tints across shortcodes, components and admin pages are written as `rgb(112 208 255 / <alpha>)` or `#70d0ff`. Changing the hue means a repo-wide replace of **both** the RGB triplet and the hex, or widgets will disagree with the chrome. New code should use `var(--accent)` or `rgb(from var(--accent) r g b / <alpha>)`.

**Type.** Two self-hosted variable fonts imported at the top of `BaseLayout.astro` (`@fontsource-variable/schibsted-grotesk`, `@fontsource-variable/source-sans-3`): `--font-ui` (Schibsted Grotesk) for headings, navigation, UI and every shortcode widget; `--font-read` (Source Sans 3) for running article text only. They bundle into `/_astro/` so the CSP's `font-src 'self'` holds: **don't use a font CDN** without adding its origins to `src/middleware.ts`. Name a face in CSS only if it is actually imported. `AdminLayout.astro` has its own `:root` and uses only the UI face. Headings follow a major-third scale from the 17px body with `text-wrap: balance`.

**Reading measure.** `--measure: 42rem` caps line length; layouts with the shared sidebar (`.page-layout--sidebar`, `.post-layout`, `.home-layout`) set it to `100%`. The reading font, measure and underlined links apply only to **direct children** of `.prose` (`> p`, `> ul`, `> ol`, `> blockquote`, `> h2`–`h4`) so widgets keep the UI font and full width. Don't loosen these to descendant selectors. In-prose `h2`s are plain `--text`.

**Layout.** `main` is the same width on every page (a narrowing variant was rejected as jarring). A page whose markdown has no `{{token}}` renders in the blog post's two-column layout with `Sidebar.astro`; pages with shortcodes keep the full panel. `privacy-policy.astro` and the homepage use the same two columns. The newest post renders into `BaseLayout`'s `headerFeature` slot as a stacked hero (header art above headline and excerpt, natural aspect ratio): the one loud element on the site. Don't reintroduce a static banner above it.

**Cards.** Cards, callouts and blockquotes use a uniform 1px frame (`border: 1px solid var(--line)`, or a tinted `rgb(<accent> / ~22%)` for semantic color) with a symmetric radius. Color lives in the icon, title, hover state and border tint. Don't reintroduce `border-left: 3px solid var(--accent)` with an asymmetric radius and a `linear-gradient(90deg, …)` wash, and don't use a top-left corner tick: both were tried and removed. The one surviving left border is `.nav-item--child` in `src/pages/admin/nav/index.astro`, which encodes tree nesting.

**Radius and transitions.** Three tiers in `:root`: `--r-sm: 6px` (chips, code, small buttons), `--r-md: 10px` (cards, panels, inputs), `--r-lg: 16px` (shells, heroes), plus `--r-pill`. Use `border-radius: var(--r-md, 10px)` (shortcode `<style>` blocks inherit `:root`, the fallback is belt-and-braces). **Don't add a fourth tier**; `0`, `50%` and hairlines may stay bare. **Never use `transition: all`**: list the properties the `:hover`/`:focus` rule changes. Children animate in their own rules (`Card.astro` transitions `.card__image img` and `.card__bg-icon` separately).

**Nav chevrons.** `.nav-caret` is a transparent button whose `::after` draws a rotated-square chevron; parent link and caret share one hover/active fill. Top-level carets point down and flip up when `aria-expanded="true"`; desktop flyout carets point left and flip right; stacked mobile carets all point down. Every state needs its **own** transform or the animation silently dies.

**Removed on purpose, don't reintroduce:** neon glow `box-shadow`s, `translateY` hover lift, fade-and-slide `@keyframes` on every `section`, the uppercase "Featured · Latest post" eyebrow, middle-dot (` · `) meta strings (use flex `gap`), and monospace profile handles. Hover feedback is a color or border-color change only.

## The shortcode system

Page/post markdown embeds widgets via `{{token}}` or `{{token attr="value"}}`, expanded by `src/lib/shortcodes.ts` **after** `renderMarkdown()`. Each shortcode is a hardcoded TS module in `src/lib/*.ts` returning a self-contained HTML string with its own inline `<style>` (and `<script>` if interactive), registered in the `SHORTCODES` map.

- **Shortcode-only pages need intro prose.** `<meta name="description">` is derived from page markdown; `descriptionFromMarkdown` strips tokens and falls back to the title, but a sentence or two of prose above the widget is what Google shows.
- **Server-render anything worth indexing.** A widget rendered only from a client JSON blob is empty to crawlers and no-JS visitors. `assisted-combat-analysis.ts` is the reference: its templates live in dependency-free `assisted-combat-render.js` (top-level `export function`/`export var` only), imported by the shortcode and inlined into the browser via `?raw`, so server and client render from identical code. The client wrapper strips `export ` with a regex and evaluates the rest in an IIFE.
- **Memoize expensive output.** The function runs on every request. Build output that is a pure function of a static import once into a module-level `cachedHtml` (see the nonce gotcha below).
- **Generated data needs a generator.** `npm run data:assisted-combat` rebuilds `src/lib/assisted-combat-data.json` from research inputs that are not in this repo (set `ASSISTED_COMBAT_RESEARCH_ROOT` and `ASSISTED_COMBAT_NOTES_ROOT`; `scripts/generate-assisted-combat-data.mjs` documents them). Every published figure derives from them; only the pinned build/commit IDs are typed by hand. Don't hardcode totals.
- **WoW spec icons are vendored.** `npm run data:spec-icons` downloads 40 icons into `public/images/wow-spec-icons/` and records the specId → icon map in `src/lib/assisted-combat-spec-icons.json`, resolved through wago.tools `ChrSpecialization` → `SpellIconFileID` → the community listfile (~100 MB, streamed and filtered, never stored). `--resolve` re-derives the map after a patch, `--force` re-downloads images. An `<img>` in `.prose` needs an `#ac-root img.ac-monogram`-style rule to beat `.prose img`.
- **`marked` HTML-escapes quotes before shortcodes run**, so `attr="value"` arrives as `attr=&quot;value&quot;`. The attribute regex decodes entities first; don't "simplify" that away.
- **Scripts must survive Astro View Transitions.** `ClientRouter` is enabled sitewide and inline scripts don't reliably re-run after in-site navigation. Interactive shortcodes follow `atlas-farming-strategies.ts` / `expedition-rumours.ts`: an IIFE whose `init()` finds its root, bails if `root.dataset.<name>Init` is set, otherwise sets it and wires listeners; call `init()` immediately (or on `DOMContentLoaded` while loading) **and** on `astro:page-load`. Test by navigating in from the nav bar, not just by typing the URL.
- **`.prose` element selectors out-specify shortcode classes.** `.prose img`, `h2`, `ul`, `p`, `li`, `a` have specificity (0,1,1) and beat a bare `.my-class`, which shows up as unexplained gaps, borders or indents. Scope with the widget's root id: `#hl-root img.hl-img{margin:0;border:0}` (see `bookmarks.ts`, `wow-featured.ts`).
- **A class-level `display` beats `hidden`.** Pair every element toggled via `el.hidden` with `<root> .cls[hidden]{display:none;}` if the class sets its own `display` (`spell-queue-lab.ts`).

## Security

**Headers.** Every page and API route is rendered by the Worker, not the static-assets layer, so `public/_headers` only affects static files. `src/middleware.ts` sets HSTS, `X-Content-Type-Options`, `Referrer-Policy`, `X-Frame-Options`, `Permissions-Policy` and `Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only` on every response. Fix a missing header in middleware, not just `_headers`.

**CSP nonces.** The CSP is Report-Only, with a per-request nonce (`Astro.locals.nonce`) on `script-src`/`style-src` and no `'unsafe-inline'`. **Every** inline `<script>`/`<style>` needs `nonce={Astro.locals.nonce}` (Astro) or `nonceAttr(nonce)` from `src/lib/csp.ts` (shortcode strings, threaded through `processShortcodes(html, nonce)` → `ShortcodeFn(attrs, nonce)`). `<script type="application/json">` and `ld+json` blocks need none. `build.inlineStylesheets: 'never'` keeps Astro's scoped styles external. Never auto-nonce user-authored HTML.

**Gotcha: memoized shortcode HTML can't bake in a nonce.** `assisted-combat-analysis.ts` and `midnight-s2-interrupts.ts` cache HTML with a `NONCE_PLACEHOLDER` and `.replaceAll()` the real nonce (or strip the attribute) per request. Don't embed `nonce` directly in `buildHtml()`.

**Before enforcing the CSP:** add a report destination or gather browser evidence, move the editor's dynamically created style to a stylesheet, deal with inline `style` attributes (a style nonce doesn't authorize them) and external favicon origins, and test nonce behavior across ClientRouter navigation.

**Inline JSON.** Use `jsonForHtml` (`src/lib/json.ts`) for every inline JSON/JSON-LD body, including `set:html` and shortcode strings; it escapes `<`, `>`, `&` so a `</script>` in a title can't end the block. Run `npm run test:json` when changing it.

**Author Markdown is sanitized.** `renderMarkdown` (`src/lib/markdown.ts`) filters Marked's output through an `xss` allowlist: unlisted tags and attributes (`style`, `on*`) are dropped, `<script>`/`<style>` lose their bodies, and `href`/`src` keep only http(s), mailto, tel, fragment and relative URLs (`data:` images refused). Shortcodes expand **after** this step, so widget markup and nonces aren't filtered: never run `processShortcodes` first and never feed author HTML into it. To allow a new tag or attribute (About uses a raw `<img class=…>`), extend the whitelist and add a case to `tests/markdown.test.ts`. `src/lib/feed.ts` has its own unsanitized `marked.parse` for feed portability only.

**Login** (`src/pages/api/auth/login.ts`) is email + password only: no app-level captcha, MFA or throttling; verify any Cloudflare edge rules separately. The app needs no runtime secrets. Local ones go in `.dev.vars` (gitignored); production ones via `wrangler secret put`.

## Analytics and privacy

`ConsentBanner.astro` is the only loader for gtag.js. It loads the tag only after acceptance (including a saved choice), stores the choice in `orboro-analytics-consent` localStorage, and leaves advertising consent denied. Footer **Cookie preferences** reopens the banner; withdrawing consent disables the tag, clears GA cookies on the host and parent domains, and reloads. A nonce-bearing `is:inline` script installs one guarded controller with document-level listeners that survive ClientRouter swaps. Keep `send_page_view: false`, send manual page views on `astro:page-load` plus one on first acceptance, and don't double count on re-acceptance. Only pages that contain the banner are tracked, so `AdminLayout` stays excluded. The tag reads the **current page's** nonce from `#analytics-controller`, not one captured earlier. Keep the explicit `[hidden]` display resets on the banner and footer button. Run `npm run test:consent` when changing this; it doesn't verify visuals or real Google traffic, so check desktop and phone layouts, refusal across navigation, acceptance after a swap, saved acceptance on reload and withdrawal in a browser.

`src/pages/privacy-policy.astro` is a code page, not a D1 row. Keep it aligned with what is actually collected and update `PRIVACY_UPDATED_AT` in `src/lib/privacy.ts` when its substance changes (the sitemap shares that date). Don't promise anonymization, no sharing or a retention period without evidence; retention and Google/Cloudflare settings need dashboard verification.

## Form feedback

`src/components/FormMessage.astro` provides shared form feedback: successes are an atomic polite status; errors take focus on arrival and link to the relevant controls, with descriptions associated without marking every linked field invalid. Keep existing hint IDs when extending `aria-describedby`. Markdown-field links must focus EasyMDE's generated input, which inherits the source textarea's error descriptions. The controller guards each summary and initializes on `astro:page-load`. Don't move focus for filtering or simulator updates; use concise polite statuses and avoid rewriting unchanged text. Content/category validation redirects return to the editor without retaining unsaved values.

## Content model and D1

- `content` holds pages and posts, split by `page_type` (`"page"` → `/pages/[slug]`, `"post"` → `/blog/[slug]`). Markdown is in `content.markdown`; shortcodes expand at render time, never stored expanded.
- `nav_items` drives the header nav: `content_id` plus an optional self-referencing `parent_item_id` for arbitrarily deep nesting (rendered as nested `.nav-flyout` submenus). A page needs no `nav_items` row to be reachable. `categories` / `content_categories` are a separate tagging system for `/category/[slug]`: don't conflate them with nav nesting.
- **Scripted content edits** go in a SQL file run with `wrangler d1 execute DB --local --file=./scratch.sql` (`--remote` for production, deliberately), not an inlined `UPDATE`. Escape single quotes as `''`.
- **A new shortcode-backed page gets an idempotent seed script in `scripts/content/`** (see `spell-queue-window-simulator.sql`): `INSERT … ON CONFLICT(slug) DO UPDATE` for the page, `INSERT OR IGNORE INTO content_categories`, and for nav an `INSERT … ON CONFLICT(id) DO UPDATE` with a hardcoded `id`. Re-running it ships later prose or label edits. Resolve `author_id` with `(SELECT id FROM users WHERE role = 'admin' ORDER BY created_at ASC LIMIT 1)`, because local and remote `users.id` differ.
- **Don't wrap these scripts in `BEGIN TRANSACTION`/`COMMIT`.** Remote D1 rejects them, and `wrangler d1 execute` already applies a file atomically.
- Local D1 (`.wrangler/state/v3/d1`) is separate from production. Apply migrations locally first, then remote. Never copy a locally observed row ID into a remote insert without checking.

## Server-side fetches and the public API

Cache external server-side fetches (see `bookmarks.ts`) with the Workers Cache API and fail gracefully with a small `<p><em>…</em></p>` fallback; a broken shortcode must not 500 the page:

```js
const cache = (caches as CacheStorage & { readonly default: Cache }).default;
let res = await cache.match(cacheKey);
if (!res) {
  res = await fetch(url);
  if (res.ok) {
    const cacheable = new Response(res.body, res);
    cacheable.headers.set("Cache-Control", `public, max-age=${TTL_SECONDS}`);
    await cache.put(cacheKey, cacheable.clone());
    res = cacheable;
  }
}
```

- `caches.default` needs the cast above: the generated `worker-configuration.d.ts` (`npm run cf:types`) doesn't type it.
- The Cache API persists to `.wrangler/state/v3/cache`, so a stale response survives a dev-server restart. Stop the server, delete `.wrangler/state/v3/cache/miniflare-CacheObject`, and restart (or wait out the TTL).
- `bookmarks.ts` filters tags into UI categories through an explicit `exclude_categories="…"` attribute rather than guessing which tags every item shares.
- `src/pages/api/posts/by-category/[slug].ts` is a public, edge-cached (10 min) JSON endpoint of published posts per category, consumed by HiddenLodgeWebsite's `/articles` page. It returns plain-text excerpts, not rendered HTML, because shortcodes only resolve inside this repo's render pipeline. A new public endpoint should return absolute URLs (`new URL(path, site.origin)`), edge-cache, and answer an unknown slug with a `404` JSON body.

## Local dev and verification

- Use `127.0.0.1`, not `localhost`: some integrations need an exact origin match. `npm run dev:astro` is fast with hot reload; `npm run dev` builds and runs `wrangler dev` with real D1/Cache/secret bindings but no hot reload. Use the latter for anything touching D1, `caches.default` or `cloudflare:workers`.
- **`astro dev` doesn't reliably pick up edits to `BaseLayout.astro`'s `<style is:global>`**, even across hard reloads. Restart it before concluding a style fix failed. If 4321 is taken, use `npx astro dev --host 127.0.0.1 --port <other>` rather than killing it.
- No headless-browser tooling is installed (Playwright was removed on purpose; don't reinstall it). Without a browser integration, confirm markup with `npm run build`, `npx wrangler dev --ip 127.0.0.1 --port 8787`, then `curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8787/pages/<slug> | grep …`. That proves HTML, scripts and shortcode expansion, **not** layout, spacing or hover states: say so rather than claiming a visual change "looks right".
