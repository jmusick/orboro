# Operations and decision history

Use [README.md](../README.md) for setup and deployment, [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) for code conventions, and git commits and tags for the detailed change record.

## Deployment configuration check — October 10, 2026

Checked GitHub with its API and Cloudflare through the authenticated Worker dashboard. These are dated observations, not a claim that account settings cannot change.

- GitHub repository: [jmusick/orboro-net](https://github.com/jmusick/orboro-net), repository ID `1231197478`, public, default branch `master`, homepage `https://orboro.net`.
- Local `origin`: `https://github.com/jmusick/orboro-net.git`. `git ls-remote` resolves `master` to `13beff8d2b70940841d5644132dd5ef057089b46`, matching the checkout and the latest deployed build.
- Cloudflare Worker: `orboro-net`. Its production Builds settings link to `jmusick/orboro-net`, use branch `master` and root `/`, and have builds enabled. Build command: `npm run build`; deploy command: `npx wrangler deploy`; include watch path: `*`.
- The build token is selected as `orboro-net build token`. No build variables or secrets are configured. An older external note claimed `NODE_VERSION=22`; the dashboard did not support that claim. The repository's Node requirement remains in `package.json`.
- GitHub's `Workers Builds: orboro-net` check succeeded for the current commit. Cloudflare shows production version `d822d5e2` ready and serving 100% of traffic. No post-rename push or new deployment was performed during this check.
- Production bindings match `wrangler.toml`: D1 `DB` → `orboro-db` (`7fe68e1c-ce42-40a6-ae78-3bb674d6ad0f`), R2 `MEDIA` → `orboro-net-media`, and static `ASSETS`. Compatibility date: `2026-04-05`; flag: `nodejs_compat`. No runtime variables or secrets are configured.
- Worker custom domain: `orboro.net`; workers.dev hostname: `orboro-net.jd-fda.workers.dev`. The R2 custom domain and its development URL were not rechecked in this review.
- Older deployment records retain `jmusick/orboro` links. The active repository connection uses the renamed repository; historical labels alone do not indicate a broken connection.

Cloudflare account settings remain outside the repository. Analytics retention, Google data sharing, live edge rules and log retention were not checked. Consult the account dashboards before making claims about them.

Reference: [Cloudflare GitHub integration](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/ci-cd/builds/git-integration/github-integration/) and [GitHub repository renames](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/renaming-a-repository).

## Security configuration observation — October 10, 2026

The authenticated zone dashboard showed an active per-IP rule for exactly `/api/auth/login`: more than two requests in ten seconds is blocked for ten seconds. The `workers.dev` login is also reachable; account limits and alternate-host coverage remain in [issue #4](https://github.com/jmusick/orboro-net/issues/4). Minimum TLS was shown as TLS 1.0 default, with TLS 1.3 enabled; review effective hostname settings and raise the floor under [issue #15](https://github.com/jmusick/orboro-net/issues/15). No settings were changed during this inspection.

GitHub secret scanning and push protection are enabled. The API showed no Actions workflows, master branch protection or rulesets, and Dependabot security updates disabled. Reproducible release checks are tracked in [issue #14](https://github.com/jmusick/orboro-net/issues/14). The [dated audit issues](https://github.com/jmusick/orboro-net/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20label%3Aaudit%3A2026-10-10) are the current backlog.

## Decision history

These rationales were consolidated from earlier project notes; they are historical, not new deployment changes.

- **v1.33.0:** moved from Cloudflare Pages to the `orboro-net` Worker.
- **v1.34.0:** removed hCaptcha and its runtime secret from admin login; login became email and password only.
- **v1.37.0:** took the palette from the logo and header art instead of the previous neon colors. Fonts became self-hosted because the prior stylesheet named an unloaded face and visitors saw Segoe UI. The homepage began leading with the newest post, and text-only pages gained the blog sidebar.
- **October 4, 2026:** removed `/admin/setup`, which was unnecessary for a one-user site and had a race on empty databases. `admin:create` handles fresh and restored databases.

## Research data

The assisted-combat generator reads external inputs through `ASSISTED_COMBAT_RESEARCH_ROOT` and `ASSISTED_COMBAT_NOTES_ROOT`. The input filenames and error handling are documented in [the generator](../scripts/generate-assisted-combat-data.mjs). Set the variables when using another workspace; do not copy personal research locations into runtime code.
